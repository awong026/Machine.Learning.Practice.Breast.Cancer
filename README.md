## Objective
Create model to predict whether a cancer is malignant or benign from biopsy details (Decision Tree Method)

## Summary
Conducted an exploratory data analysis of BreastCancer data. Then created plots like histrograms of each predictor variable split by response variable Class (Beign or Malignant). Split data into train and test set. Then created a full model using decision tree method. Then pruned full model to get "best" model. Then checked the accruacy of models using test set. 

Received feedback from another coder and redid process above using feedback. 

## Conclusion:
I was able to create a model that was 94% accurate at predicting if a cancer was malignant or beign from biopsy details.
